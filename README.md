# 🚌 Smart School Bus Tracking System (SSB 1.0)

## 📘 Overview

**Smart School Bus Tracking System (SSB 1.0)** is a web-based and mobile-friendly platform designed to enhance safety and transparency in school transportation.
It enables **administrators**, **drivers**, and **parents** to manage and monitor the school bus system efficiently through real-time tracking, scheduling, and notifications.

This project aims to digitize the bus management process and ensure better communication between all stakeholders.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

* Improve student safety during pickup and drop-off.
* Provide parents with real-time bus location updates.
* Help school admins manage buses, drivers, and schedules efficiently.
* Replace manual tracking (calls, messages, spreadsheets) with automated tools.

## 🚀 Installation

### Prerequisites

* Node.js ≥ 18.x
* MySQL ≥ 8.x
* npm or yarn

### Steps

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-org>/smart-school-bus-tracking.git
cd smart-school-bus-tracking

# Backend setup
cd backend
npm install
npm start

# Frontend setup
cd ../frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open your browser at **[http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)** (or the configured port).

## 📡 Real-time Tracking Flow

1. **Bus device (or driver app)** sends GPS coordinates to backend via Socket.IO.
2. **Backend** updates location and broadcasts data to subscribed parents/admins.
3. **Frontend (React)** displays bus marker updates on the map in real time.
